rocThrust documentation
******************************************

rocThrust is a parallel algorithm library that has been ported to `HIP <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/HIP/en/latest/index.html>`_ and `ROCm <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/>`_, and uses the `rocPRIM <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocPRIM/en/latest/index.html>`_ library.

The rocThrust project is located in https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries/tree/develop/projects/rocthrust.
