Once rocThrust has been installed, these example programs can be compiled
directly with hipcc. For example, the following command will compile the
norm example.
  $ hipcc norm.cu -o norm

These examples are also available online:
  https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries/tree/develop/projects/rocthrust/examples

We also provide consistent and convenient development environments as [devcontainers](../../.devcontainers/README.md).
