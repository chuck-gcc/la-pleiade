# hipother

> [!CAUTION]
> The hipother repository is retired, please use the [ROCm/rocm-systems](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-systems/tree/develop/projects/hipother) repository for development. This `develop` branch will only accept patch updates from a bot that mirrors hipother-specific updates from `rocm-systems` into here.

This repository provides files required to support non-AMD specific back-end implementation for [HIP](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-systems/tree/develop/projects/hip).
