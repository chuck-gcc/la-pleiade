- Replaced deprecated `hipHostMalloc` and `hipHostFree` functions with `hipExtHostAlloc` and `hipFreeHost` for ROCm versions starting 6.3.
- Updated `rocprofv3` `--help` options.
- Changed naming of "agent profiling" to a more descriptive "device counting service". To convert existing tool or user code to the new name, use the following sed:
`find . -type f -exec sed -i 's/rocprofiler_agent_profile_callback_t/rocprofiler_device_counting_service_callback_t/g; s/rocprofiler_configure_agent_profile_counting_service/rocprofiler_configure_device_counting_service/g; s/agent_profile.h/device_counting_service.h/g; s/rocprofiler_sample_agent_profile_counting_service/rocprofiler_sample_device_counting_service/g' {} +`
- Changed naming of "dispatch profiling service" to a more descriptive "dispatch counting service". To convert existing tool or user code to the new names, the following sed can be used: `-type f -exec sed -i -e 's/dispatch_profile_counting_service/dispatch_counting_service/g' -e 's/dispatch_profile.h/dispatch_counting_service.h/g' -e 's/rocprofiler_profile_counting_dispatch_callback_t/rocprofiler_dispatch_counting_service_callback_t/g' -e 's/rocprofiler_profile_counting_dispatch_data_t/rocprofiler_dispatch_counting_service_data_t/g'  -e 's/rocprofiler_profile_counting_dispatch_record_t/rocprofiler_dispatch_counting_service_record_t/g' {} +`
- `FETCH_SIZE` metric on gfx94x now uses `TCC_BUBBLE` for 128B reads.

### Resolved issues

- Fixed missing callbacks around internal thread creation within counter collection service.
- Fixed potential data race in the ROCprofiler-SDK double buffering scheme.

- Fixed the system hang issue for host-trap PC-sampling on MI300X.
- Fixed `rocpd` counter collection issue when counter collection alone is enabled. `rocpd_kernel_dispatch` table is updated to be populated by counters data instead of kernel_dispatch data.
- Fixed `rocprofiler_*_id_t` structs for inconsistency related to a "null" handle:
  - The correct definition for a null handle is `.handle = 0` while some definitions previously used `UINT64_MAX`.
- Fixed kernel trace csv output generated by `rocpd`.

### Removed

- Support for compilation of gfx940 and gfx941 targets.


## ROCprofiler-SDK 1.1.0 for ROCm release 7.1

### Added
- Dynamic process attachment- ROCprofiler-sdk and `rocprofv3` now facilitate dynamic profiling of a running GPU applications by attaching to its process ID (PID), rather than launching the application through the profiler itself.
- Scratch-memory trace information to the Perfetto output in `rocprofv3`.
- New capabilities to the thread trace support in `rocprofv3`, including real-time clock support for thread trace alignment on gfx9 architecture. This enables high-resolution clock computation and better synchronization across shader engines. Additionally, `MultiKernelDispatch` thread trace support is now available across all ASICs.
- Documentation for dynamic process attachment.
- Documentation for `rocpd` summaries.


### Optimized
- Improved the stability and robustness of the `rocpd` output.
