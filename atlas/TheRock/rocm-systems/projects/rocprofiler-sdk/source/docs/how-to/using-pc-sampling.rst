==================
Using PC sampling
==================

PC (Program Counter) sampling service for GPU profiling is a profiling technique to periodically sample the program counter during GPU kernel execution. PC sampling helps in understanding code execution patterns and identifying hotspot(s).

Here are the benefits of using PC sampling:

- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Understand kernel execution behavior
- Analyze code coverage
- Find heavily executed code paths

To try out the PC sampling feature, you can use the command-line tool ``rocprofv3`` or the ROCprofiler-SDK library on `ROCm 6.4` or later.

.. note::
  PC sampling is ONLY supported on AMD GPUs with architectures gfx90a and later.

PC sampling availability and configuration
===========================================

To check if the GPU supports PC sampling, use:

.. code-block:: bash

  rocprofv3 -L

Or

.. code-block:: bash

  rocprofv3 --list-avail

The output lists if ``rocprofv3`` supports PC sampling on the GPU and the supported configuration.

.. code-block:: bash

    GPU:0
    NAME:gfx90a
    configs:
       Method              :host_trap
       Unit                :time
       Min_Interval        :1
       Max_Interval        :18446744073709551615
       Flags               :none

The preceding output shows that the GPU supports PC sampling with the ``ROCPROFILER_PC_SAMPLING_METHOD_HOST_TRAP`` method and the ``ROCPROFILER_PC_SAMPLING_UNIT_TIME`` unit. The minimum and maximum intervals are also displayed.

.. note::
   Important firmware fixes to host-trap and stochastic PC-sampling for AMD Instinct MI300X have been made in ROCm 7.0.
   To ensure that you have the latest fixes, check if you have the correct firmware versions installed:

   For host-trap PC-sampling on MI300X: PSP TOS Firmware >= version 00.36.02.59 or 0x00360259
   For stochastic PC-sampling on MI300X  as described in the following section: MEC Firmware feature version: 50, firmware version >= 0x0000001a

To check the firmware versions, use:

.. code-block:: bash

  # To check PSP TOS Firmware:
  sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/amdgpu_firmware_info | grep SOS

  # To check MEC Firmware:
  sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/1/amdgpu_firmware_info | grep MEC

Based on the available PC-sampling configurations, use the following command to profile the application using PC-sampling:

.. code-block:: bash

  rocprofv3 --pc-sampling-beta-enabled --pc-sampling-method host_trap --pc-sampling-unit time --pc-sampling-interval 1 --output-format csv -- <application_path>

The preceding command enables PC sampling with the ``host_trap`` method, ``time`` unit, and an interval of ``1`` μs (microsecond). Replace ``<application_path>`` with the path to the application you want to profile.

This generates two files, ``agent_info.csv`` and ``pc_sampling_host_trap.csv``. Both files are prefixed with the process ID.

Here are the contents of ``pc_sampling_host_trap.csv`` file generated for MatrixTranspose sample application:

.. _pc_sampling_host_trap:

.. csv-table:: PC sampling host trap
   :file: /data/pc_sampling_host_trap.csv
   :widths: 20,10,10,10,10,20
   :header-rows: 1


For description of the fields in the output file, see :ref:`pc-sampling-fields`.

If you find the ``Instruction_Comment`` field in the output file to be empty, populate this field by compiling your application with debug symbols.
Enabling debug symbols while compiling the application maps back to the source line. This helps in understanding the code execution pattern and hotspots.

.. csv-table:: PC sampling host trap with debug symbols
   :file: /data/pc_sampling_host_trap_debug.csv
   :widths: 20,10,10,10,10,20
   :header-rows: 1


The preceding output shows the ``Instruction_Comment`` field populated with the source-line information.

.. _pc-sampling-fields:

PC sampling fields
===================

Here are the fields in the output file generated by PC sampling:

- ``Sample_Timestamp``: Timestamp when sample is generated
- ``Exec_Mask``: Active SIMD lanes when sampled
- ``Dispatch_Id``: Originating kernel dispatch ID
- ``Instruction``: Assembly instruction such as ``s_load_dword s8, s[1:2], 0x10``
- ``Instruction_Comment``: Instruction comment that maps back to the source-line if debug symbols were enabled when application was compiled
- ``Correlation_Id``: API launch call ID that matches dispatch ID

 To dump samples in a more comprehensive format, use JSON through ``--output-format json``:

.. code-block:: bash

  rocprofv3 --pc-sampling-beta-enabled --pc-sampling-method host_trap --pc-sampling-unit time --pc-sampling-interval 1 --output-format json -- <application_path>

The preceding command generates a JSON file with the comprehensive output. Here is a trimmed down output with multiple records:

Host-trap PC sampling and arbitrary sampling skid
==================================================

Host-trap PC sampling is a software-based technique that utilizes a background kernel thread
to periodically interrupt running waves to capture the program counter (PC).
This method is effective for gathering performance data without requiring specialized hardware
to snapshot the waves. However, this method has certain limitations due to the potential delay between
receiving and processing the interrupt by the wave to capture the PC.
This delay can lead to a sampling skid, where the PC samples might be attributed to the instructions
that are up to two instructions away from the actual source of latency.
This results in a non-precise intra-kernel sampling method.

When analyzing an application profile generated by host-trap PC sampling,
it is important to consider not only the costliest reported instruction but
also the instructions immediately preceding or following it.
If the costly instruction is near a branch instruction, it is important
to consider the instruction targeted by the branch and the one immediately following it as well.

To address the limitations of host-trap sampling, the hardware-based stochastic PC sampling method
has been developed. This method provides precise intra-kernel sampling with zero sampling skid,
offering more accurate performance insights.

It is important to note that the skid issue inherent in host-trap PC sampling is not likely to be resolved
in its current form. Therefore, to achieve more precise performance profiling, it is recommended to adopt stochastic PC sampling starting with the gfx942 architecture.

.. note::

  Host-trap PC sampling is supported on AMD Instinct MI200, MI300, MI325, MI350, and MI355.

Hardware-based (stochastic) PC sampling method
===============================================

The ``ROCPROFILER_PC_SAMPLING_METHOD_STOCHASTIC`` method has been introduced for the gfx942 architecture.
It employs a specific hardware for probing waves actively running on the GPU.
Besides the information already provided with ``ROCPROFILER_PC_SAMPLING_METHOD_HOST_TRAP`` useful for
determining hotspots within the kernel, this method delivers additional information, which helps to determine
whether a sampled wave issued an instruction represented with the specified PC.
If not, this method provides the reason for not issuing the instruction (stall reason).
Such information is particularly useful for understanding stalls during kernel execution.

To use this method on gfx942, it is recommended to list available PC sampling configurations to verify if the latest ROCm stack is installed on the system using:

.. code-block:: bash

  rocprofv3 -L

An output similar to the following indicates that the ``ROCPROFILER_PC_SAMPLING_METHOD_STOCHASTIC`` method is available:

.. code-block:: bash

    GPU:1
    NAME:gfx942
    configs:
       Method              :stochastic
       Unit                :cycle
       Min_Interval        :256
       Max_Interval        :2147483648
       Flags               :interval pow2

.. note::

  On gfx942, ``ROCPROFILER_PC_SAMPLING_METHOD_STOCHASTIC`` requires intervals to be specified in cycles with values as powers of 2.

To profile an application with ``ROCPROFILER_PC_SAMPLING_METHOD_STOCHASTIC`` PC sampling enabled on gfx942, use:

.. code-block:: bash

  rocprofv3 --pc-sampling-beta-enabled --pc-sampling-method stochastic --pc-sampling-unit cycles --pc-sampling-interval 1048576 --output-format csv, json -- <application_path>

The preceding command serializes samples in both CSV and JSON output formats in the ``pc_sampling_stochastic.csv`` and ``out_results.json`` files, respectively.

On comparing the :ref:`pc_sampling_stochastic.csv <pc_sampling_stochastic>` to :ref:`pc_sampling_host_trap.csv <pc_sampling_host_trap>`, you can notice that the ``ROCPROFILER_PC_SAMPLING_METHOD_STOCHASTIC`` method
generates the following additional fields:

- ``Wave_Issued_Instruction``: Indicates whether the wave issued an instruction represented with the specified PC. Value = 1 for yes and 0 for no.

- ``Instruction_Type``: If the value of ``Wave_Issued_Instruction`` is 1, this field indicates the type of the issued instruction. Otherwise, this field remains irrelevant.

- ``Stall_Reason``: If the value of ``Wave_Issued_Instruction`` is 0, this field indicates the reason for not issuing the instruction (stall reason). Otherwise, this field remains irrelevant.

- ``Wave_Count``: Total number of waves actively running on a compute unit when the sample is generated.

   :widths: 20,10,10,10,10,20,10,20,20,10
   :header-rows: 1

Similarly, ``ROCPROFILER_PC_SAMPLING_METHOD_STOCHASTIC`` method delivers additional information to every sample in the JSON output.

Here is a ``out_results.json`` file sample:

        "arb_state_issue_scalar": 0,
        "arb_state_issue_vmem_tex": 0,
        "arb_state_issue_flat": 0,
        "arb_state_issue_exp": 0,
        "arb_state_issue_misc": 0,
        "arb_state_issue_brmsg": 0,
        "arb_state_stall_valu": 0,
        "arb_state_stall_matrix": 0,
        "arb_state_stall_lds": 0,
        "arb_state_stall_lds_direct": 0,
        "arb_state_stall_scalar": 0,
        "arb_state_stall_vmem_tex": 0,
        "arb_state_stall_flat": 0,
        "arb_state_stall_exp": 0,
        "arb_state_stall_misc": 0,
        "arb_state_stall_brmsg": 0
      }
    },
    "inst_index": 1
  },

Fields starting with ``arb_state_`` are of particular interest as they indicate the state of the arbiter at the time of sampling.
For example, ``arb_state_issue_`` fields indicate the type of instructions issued by the arbiter at the time of sampling.
On the other hand, ``arb_state_stall_`` fields indicate the type of instructions stalled at the time of sampling.
This information is useful for understanding how many instructions per cycle (IPC) are issued.

.. note::

  The stochastic PC sampling is supported on AMD Instinct MI300, MI325, MI350, and MI355.
