.. note::

   Analysis examples in this chapter borrow profiling results from the
   ``vcopy.cpp`` workload introduced in :ref:`profile-example` in the
   previous chapter.

   Unless otherwise noted, the performance analysis is done on the
   :ref:`MI200 platform <def-soc>`.

Learn about profiling with ROCm Compute Profiler in :doc:`../profile/mode`. For an overview of
ROCm Compute Profiler's other modes, see :ref:`modes`.
