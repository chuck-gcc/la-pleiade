/**
 * This file describes the instrumentation format for rocprof trace decoder 0.1.3.
 * Instrumentation is optional for decoding, with the exception of rocprof_trace_decoder_gfx9_header_t.
 * Unless specified, all instrumentation packets are written to the USERDATA2 register.
 * This is an experimental feature, and as such the instrumentation may be changed without notice.
 *
 * It is recommended to use code object instrumentation for long traces, to avoid overlapping address spaces
 * if code objects are loaded/unloaded during the trace.
 * When an ID is found, callbacks involving _trace_decoder_pc_t will return {id, vaddr} instead of {0, memory_address}.
